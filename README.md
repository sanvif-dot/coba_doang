# Bank Marketing End-to-End Data Pipeline

## Bussiness Overview

A banking institution conducted campaigns to promote term deposits to its clients, primarily using telemarketing methods like direct phone calls. The target variable (y) indicates whether the client agreed ('yes') or declined ('no') to place a deposit after the campaign. 

The bank aims to identify the features or client statuses that lead to successful offers, making their campaigns more cost and time efficient.
